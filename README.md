# RetroWrapper

**NOTICE**
This isn't maintained anymore and probably will never be maintained again, sorry. This was a quick proof of concept that showed that it's possible to fix old Minecraft versions without touching original jars. If you are looking for a more up to date version with more features and cleaner code then check out this fork.

**SINGLEPLAYER HACKS**

- Teleport hack (useful for checking farlands!)

Works all the way from 0.27 to Release 1.0, havent tested other versions but propably it works too.

You need to add -Dretrowrapper.hack=true to Java arguments in your launcher.

**HOW TO USE (manual)**

Download retrowrapper-1.2.jar from releases.

Navigate to .minecraft/libraries/com/

Create new folder 'zero' and navigate to it

Create new folder 'retrowrapper' inside 'zero' and navigate to it

Create new folder '1.2' inside 'retrowrapper' and navigate to it

Copy retrowrapper-1.2.jar to '1.2'

Now go into .minecraft/versions/

Copy that folder you want to patch and add -retro to its name (eg. c0.30_01 to c0.30_01-retro)

Go inside that folder and add -retro to all filenames inside it

Edit <version>.json and
  
- add -retro to id (eg. replace **"id": "c0.30_01c",* with *"id": "c0.30_01c-retro",**)
- replace **"libraries":** with **"libraries": [{"name": "com.zero:retrowrapper:1.2"},**
- replace **--tweakClass net.minecraft.launchwrapper....VanillaTweaker** with **--tweakClass com.zero.retrowrapper.RetroTweaker**
  
Launch Minecraft and choose newly created version!
